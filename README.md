# DNS_GetHostbyNameAsync

This example shows how to make asynchronous DNS host name resolution.
 
**Note:** The current example is limited to the ethernet interface on supported devices.
To use the example with a different interface, you will need to modify main.cpp and
replace the EthernetInterface class with the appropriate interface.
